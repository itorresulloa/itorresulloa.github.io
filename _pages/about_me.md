Hi!

Before starting my PhD in economics, I worked as a research assistant at the Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie), and as a research consultant on impact evaluations for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), and Chilean government offices.
At the same time, I collaborated on research with various professors, primarily from the University of Chile's department of industrial engineering and the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile's department of economics and the school of government.

I have experience designing, implementing, and analyzing field and online randomized controlled trials. Some of the topics that I have been involved in are early childhood development, public procurement, household finance, housing and residential mobility, migration and beliefs, and consumption warning labels, among others.

I graduated from the University of Chile with a BA in Economics and then a Master's degree in Philosophy of Science from the University of Santiago, Chile. Along with experimental research and development economics, I am motivated by the philosophical issues of causal inference, evidence extrapolation, and generalizability, as well as how to improve our estimations to validate causal statements.
